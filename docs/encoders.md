# Encoders

## Kmk Part

Peg Supports encoders configured using an [Rotary Encoder
Scanners](http://kmkfw.io/docs/scanners#rotary-encoder-scanners).  With this
your keymap will hold your encoder keycodes and your keymap keycodes.  For your
keyboard to be supported you need to configure it with the keycodes for encoders
after your keymap keycodes. Eg: 67 key keyboard with one encoder should have 69
keycodes in each layer 67 for the main matrix and 2 for the single encoder at
the end of each layer array.

## Peg part

The peg client can not guarantee that main.py or layout.json will be loaded
first.  Because of that we need to know the encoder count in both places.

Main.py:

 In main.py add these comments.

 ```python
# encodercount
# 2
# encodercount
 ```

 `# encodercount` Is just like any other wrapping comment in Peg, the only
 difference is that in this case we only wrap another comment.

 That comment being a space and number stating how many encoders this keymap
 has.

 Layout.json:

 Like we go over in the [layout docs](./layout.md) Encoders have 2 fields in the
 `"features":{` object.

 ```json
"encoders": true,
"encoderCount": 2,
 ```

* `encoders`
  * bool
* `encoderCount`
  * int
